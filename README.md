Alternatively, if the player selects the wrong answer, the screen will display incorrect, with the correct image as well.
If the player runs out of time, the screen will that time's up and display the correct answer.
On the final screen, the number of correct answers, incorrect answers, and an option to restart the game (without reloading the page) will be displayed.
